		<t>In the last few years, mental illness has come out to be a major issue in society. Teens and young adults now more than ever are having to face different issues such as depression and other social problems. According to www.livescience.com, one in every 11 teenagers is facing a major episode of depression, a 2.6% increase within the last decade. When a child keeps their emotions bottled up, their depression may lead to very dangerous habits such as alcoholism, smoking, or even drugs, according to www.verywellmind.com. When depression becomes more evolved, it can make a person feel like they do not belong in the world. An average of 5,000 kids in the United States take their own life a year, however, 50 years ago, the total was less than one-third of what it is today, according to www.mentalhealthamerica.net. Mental health is a major issue in today’s society and by providing a service that helps those suffering from their issues, people can lower their stress levels and avoid dangerous activities that can only hurt them more. Opening up about one’s true emotions helps the person feel loved and cared about. It is important for a person dealing with an episode of depression to feel as if they matter and that there are many people who care about them. By creating an anonymous website where people can share their problems and receive positive encouragement, people open up and hopefully feel more secure by the fact that there are others in their situation who are helping each other in their rough times.
