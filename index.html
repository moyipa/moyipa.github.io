                   In the last few years, mental illness has come out to be a major issue in society. 
                   Teens and young adults now more than ever are having to face different issues such as 
                   depression and other social problems. One in every 11 teenagers 
                   is facing a major episode of depression, a 2.6% increase within the last decade. When a child 
                   keeps their emotions bottled up, their depression may lead to very dangerous habits such as alcoholism, 
                   smoking, or even drugs. When depression becomes more evolved, it 
                   can make a person feel like they do not belong in the world. An average of 5,000 kids in the United 
                   States take their own life a year, however, 50 years ago, the total was less than one-third of what it 
                   is today. Mental health is a major issue in today’s society and by providing a service that helps those 
                   suffering from their issues, people can lower their stress levels and avoid dangerous activities that can 
                   only hurt them more. Opening up about one’s true emotions helps the person feel loved and cared about.
                   It is important for a person dealing with an episode of depression to feel as if they matter and that 
                   there are many people who care about them. By creating an anonymous website where people can share 
                   their problems and receive positive encouragement, people open up and hopefully feel more secure by the 
                   fact that there are others in their situation who are helping each other in their rough times.
